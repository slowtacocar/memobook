# memobook

A simple note-taking app written with Electron

**I'm not updating memobook. Check out Standard Notes, a really nice open source notes app.**

See Releases to the right for installer packages for all major operating systems.

Run `npm install` to build dependencies, and then run `npm start` to run a development build of the project.
